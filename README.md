Ever noticed how our devices have validators for almost everything?

Code error? Compiler yells.

Wrong config? System nags.

Low battery? Pop-up panic.

But when it comes to suspicious links, your personal device just lets you YOLO-click your way into regret. 🤯

This project started as a random 2 AM thought with a friend:

"Why don’t we have something that automatically checks links before we click them?"

And boom — LinkChecker was born 🎉

It:
✅ Scans and validates links before you even open them
✅ Warns you about shady, broken, or suspicious URLs
✅ Saves you from the “click first, regret later” trap

🚀 What’s Next?

We’re not stopping at a side project.
Right now, we’re actively working on turning LinkChecker into a full-fledged inbuilt app.
Oh, and did we mention? 👉 We’re already in talks with multiple unicorn startups and a couple of established MNCs 👀

The dream: a world where sketchy links don’t stand a chance.
